AbkToPgn

This ABKToPGN is based on the Idea from Lence Perkins & https://www.chessprogramming.org/ABK


I included abkTest.abk this file was generated with Arena Chess http://www.playwitharena.de/

In Programm.cs just Change var path = @"C:\_ChessSuite-Project\abkTest.abk";

Open Points / TODO

The Logic works Fine ;-)
Export to Console with with SAN Header is fixed now!


Export to File with SAN Header will come after solving during the next days when Speeding up the Code and doing some Multithreading ;-)

This Programm was developed in C# with Visual Studio Community Edition 2019

Cheers M.Baum & R.Malicki Have Fun
